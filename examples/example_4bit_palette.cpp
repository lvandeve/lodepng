LodePNG 4-bit palette example.
This example encodes a 511x511 PNG with a 4-bit palette.
Both image and palette contain sine waves, resulting in a sort of plasma.
The 511 (rather than power of two 512) size is of course chosen on purpose to
confirm that scanlines not filling up an entire byte size are working.

NOTE: a PNG image with a translucent palette is perfectly valid. However there
exist some programs that cannot correctly read those, including, surprisingly,
Gimp 2.8 image editor (until you set mode to RGB).
